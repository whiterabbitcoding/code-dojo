what is feature branching?

Feature Branching:
In this strategy, each new feature or development task is implemented in a dedicated branch. Feature branches are created from a main development branch (such as "develop" or "master"), and once the feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch. This approach allows for parallel development and isolation of features.

What is git flow?

Git Flow, as mentioned earlier, is a popular branching model that defines specific branches for different purposes, including feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches. It provides a structured workflow for collaborating on software projects, emphasizing controlled releases and parallel development.

Trunk-Based Development?

Trunk-Based Development involves maintaining a single branch, often the main branch, and committing changes directly to it. Developers work on small, incremental changes and ensure the code is always in a deployable state. Continuous integration and automated tests play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the main branch.
