Suade notes

What is suade?

Regulatory tech for big banks

In simple terms it refers to any technology that ensures companies comply with their regulatory requirements.
Example - ensure customers statements go out 48 hours after period - regtech is analysing these and ensuring its done, if not flagging it

Certino was regtech to a degree where we were helping companies ensure they paid the right amount of tax to each country per employee. A similarity would be tax legislation is always changing therefore compliance requirements are always changing, so it is a challenging field as your taxing large clunky and detailed documents and transitioning them into software requirements, so there probbably similar systems which map business terms and compliance terms into fields in a database which are calculated by your engines

Suade improves regulatory experience
